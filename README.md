# 🧪 TDD-Based String Calculator | Incubyte Campus Placement Assignment

This project is a **TDD-first implementation** of the classic **String Calculator Kata**, submitted as part of the **Incubyte Campus Placement (Round 1)** assignment.

It demonstrates strict adherence to **Test-Driven Development**, clean Java practices, and comprehensive JUnit testing.

---## 📌 What is TDD?

> **🧪 TDD (Test-Driven Development)** is a software development methodology where you:
> 
> 1️⃣ **Write tests before writing the actual code**  
> 2️⃣ Only write code that is required to pass the test  
> 3️⃣ Continuously **refactor** and improve the implementation  

It follows a simple but powerful cycle:

🔁 **Red → Green → Refactor**

- 🔴 **Red**: Write a failing test  
- 🟢 **Green**: Write the minimum code to make the test pass  
- 🔄 **Refactor**: Clean up the code while keeping all tests green

## 📐 TDD Approach Followed in This Project

This project was built **strictly using TDD** principles. Here's how I approached it:

✅ **Step-by-Step Process**:
- ✍️ Wrote **failing test cases first** (e.g., empty input, newlines, negatives, etc.)
- 🧱 Wrote just enough **code to make the tests pass**
- 🧹 Performed **refactoring after each passing test** to improve code structure
- ♻️ Repeated the cycle for each new feature

📘 **TDD Laws (by Uncle Bob)**:
> 🧑‍🏫 The Three Laws of TDD:
> 
> 1. You may not write production code unless you have a failing test.  
> 2. You may not write more of a test than is sufficient to fail.  
> 3. You may not write more production code than is sufficient to pass the test.
